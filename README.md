## Projects:
- How do you measure a radial velocity from a single absorption line? What losses do you suffer if you do this with a cross-correlation with a bad template? How do these results scale up to spectra that contain many lines?
- How does spectral extraction (from two-d images to one-d spectra) or interpolation onto common wavelength grids mess with radial-velocity measurements?
- What happens if the spectrum varies with time? Doesn't that ruin everything? Maybe it doesn't!
