**Abstract:** In the world of extreme precision radial-velocity measurements, enormous numbers of photons are gathered at very high spectral resolution to obtain supremely accurate measurements of stellar radial velocities. These projects have been incredibly successful, discovering and characterizing many hundreds of planets around other stars. A question arises late in the data-analysis chain: How best to measure a radial velocity of a star, given a good spectrum? Most pipelines adopt a cross-correlation methodology, using some kind of mask or template. Here we discuss the connection of these techniques to model fitting, make suggestions for the in-detail execution of the cross-correlations, and show how to build the cross-correlation template that delivers the highest possible precision on the radial velocity measurements. We quantitatively assess how much information is being lost from stellar velocity measurements because present-day projects are using improper templates. We find XXX and YYY. The analyses in this project are performed on a spectrum with a single spectral line; we discuss how to scale these up to full stellar spectra (with many thousands of lines).
