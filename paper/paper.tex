\section{Introduction}

Accurate spectroscopic measurements of radial velocities (RVs) have long been a critical tool across many subfields of astronomy, from galactic dynamics to cosmic expansion. In recent decades, however, a new focus has emerged on \textit{extremely precise} RV measurements of stars as a means of detecting exoplanets. For this application, measuring the absolute velocity of the star is much less important than resolving its changes through time. With sub-\ms-level precision required for the detection of Earth-like planets, vast amounts of effort have been poured into the engineering challenges of constructing a sufficiently stable spectrograph (or, failing that, being able to track the drift of a spectrograph over time) \todo{(cite some review papers)}. At the same time, great strides have been made towards disentangling true Doppler shifts from imitative signals like stellar pulsations and magnetic activity features \todo{(cite some review papers)}.  In this work, we investigate another fundamentally important but less commonly discussed aspect of the quest for maximum-precision RVs: the method of analysis used to extract the RV from a stellar spectrum.

\section{Overview of Methods}

cross-correlation vs. max likelihood

for either of these, you could use:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``binary'' mask
\item synthetic spectrum
\item data-driven synthetic spectrum
\end{itemize}

information theory based discussion of these: compute the CRLB for velocity

\label{fig:binarymask}
\end{figure}


\section{Generating Test Spectra}

how the model works in general, Doppler shifting, parameterization of white noise. number of lines.

additional noise considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\item (micro-) telluric features
\item subtle continuum trends
\item cosmic rays?
\end{itemize}

another important consideration is how well the mask/template fits the data. summarize masks and templates tried (do they know the correct relative line depths and locations?).
